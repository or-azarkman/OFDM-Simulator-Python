# OFDM System Overview

## Overview
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a multi-carrier modulation technique widely used in modern wireless communication systems such as Wi-Fi, LTE, and 5G.

OFDM divides the available bandwidth into multiple orthogonal subcarriers, each modulated with a low-rate data stream. This structure significantly reduces inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by multipath propagation and enables simple frequency-domain equalization at the receiver.

All signals in this project are modeled at the **complex baseband level**, focusing on PHY-layer signal processing rather than RF front-end implementation.

This document defines the system-level architecture, key parameters, and simulation scope of the OFDM PHY-layer simulation.

## OFDM Signal Model (Overview)

Each OFDM symbol is generated by applying an **Inverse FFT (IFFT)** to a block of modulated symbols:

$$
x[n] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X_k \cdot e^{j 2 \pi k n / N}, \quad n = 0, 1, \dots, N-1
$$

Where:  
- \(X_k\) : modulated symbol on subcarrier \(k\) (e.g., QPSK or 16-QAM)  
- \(N\) : FFT size / number of subcarriers  

> **Explanation:** The IFFT converts frequency-domain symbols \(X_k\) into a time-domain OFDM waveform \(x[n]\). This ensures orthogonality between subcarriers and enables simple frequency-domain equalization at the receiver.

A **cyclic prefix (CP)** of length \(N_{CP}\) is appended to each OFDM symbol to prevent inter-symbol interference (ISI) due to channel delay spread:

$$
x_{CP}[n] = x[N-N_{CP}+n], \quad n = 0,1,\dots,N_{CP}-1
$$

The transmitted OFDM symbol is then:

$$
x_{tx}[n] = [x_{CP}[0], x_{CP}[1], \dots, x_{CP}[N_{CP}-1], x[0], x[1], \dots, x[N-1]]
$$

> **Explanation:** The cyclic prefix replicates the last \(N_{CP}\) samples of the OFDM symbol at the beginning, ensuring that delayed copies caused by multipath do not interfere with the next symbol.

## Simulation Parameters

| Parameter                | Value        | Description / Notes                               |
|--------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|

| Cyclic Prefix length     | 16          | 25% of FFT size, typical for OFDM systems        |
| Modulation Scheme        | QPSK / 16-QAM | Configurable per simulation                      |
| Number of OFDM symbols   | 1000        | Provides sufficient BER accuracy                 |
| SNR range                | 0–20 dB     | Used for BER vs SNR performance evaluation       |

**Parameter Rationale:**  
The selected FFT and CP lengths reflect commonly used values in practical OFDM systems and provide a balance between spectral efficiency and robustness to ISI. All parameters are configurable to support experimentation and performance analysis.
