# OFDM System Overview

## Overview

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (**OFDM**) is a multi‑carrier modulation technique widely used in modern wireless communication systems such as Wi‑Fi, LTE, and 5G. In OFDM, a high‑rate bitstream is divided into multiple parallel low‑rate streams, each carried on its own orthogonal subcarrier. This approach improves spectral efficiency and robustness to channel impairments such as multipath propagation. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

All signals in this project are modeled at the **complex baseband level**, focusing on PHY‑layer signal processing rather than RF front‑end implementation.

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the OFDM system, including **system architecture, signal model, receiver processing, simulation parameters, and future extensions**.

## Mathematical Foundations

### OFDM Time‑Domain Symbol Generation

Each OFDM symbol is generated by applying an **Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT)** to a block of modulated symbols:

\[
x[n] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X_k \cdot e^{j 2 \pi k n / N}, \quad n = 0,1,\dots,N-1
\]

Where:  
- \(X_k\): modulated data symbol on subcarrier \(k\) (e.g., QPSK or 16‑QAM)  
- \(N\): FFT size (number of subcarriers)

> **Explanation:** The IFFT maps frequency‑domain symbols \(X_k\) to a time‑domain waveform \(x[n]\). The subcarriers are orthogonal, enabling simple frequency‑domain recovery at the receiver.

---

### Cyclic Prefix (CP) Construction

To mitigate inter‑symbol interference (ISI) due to multipath propagation, a cyclic prefix of length \(N_{CP}\) is appended to each OFDM symbol:

\[
x_{\text{CP}}[n] = x[N - N_{CP} + n], \quad n = 0,1,\dots,N_{CP}-1
\]

The transmitted OFDM symbol becomes:

\[
x_{\text{tx}}[n] = [x_{\text{CP}}[0], \dots, x_{\text{CP}}[N_{CP}-1], x[0], \dots, x[N-1]]
\]

> **Explanation:** The cyclic prefix consists of samples copied from the end of the OFDM symbol and prepended at the beginning. This guard interval prevents inter‑symbol interference and preserves subcarrier orthogonality when the signal passes through a dispersive channel. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Modulation Mapping

### QPSK

Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) maps groups of 2 bits into a complex symbol:

\[
s = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\big((2b_0 - 1) + j(2b_1 - 1)\big)
\]

Where the normalization \(1/\sqrt{2}\) ensures unit average power.

---

### 16‑QAM

16‑QAM (16‑Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) maps groups of 4 bits into a complex symbol:

\[
s = \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}}\left[(2b_0 + b_1 - 1.5) + j(2b_2 + b_3 - 1.5)\right]
\]

The normalization \(1/\sqrt{10}\) equalizes average symbol power to that of QPSK.

> **Explanation:** Gray coding is used in both QPSK and 16‑QAM. Gray coding ensures adjacent constellation points differ by only one bit, which reduces the probability of bit errors due to noise.

---

## Receiver Processing

At the receiver, the following steps are applied to recover the transmitted bits:

1. **Cyclic Prefix Removal** – The cyclic prefix is removed from each received OFDM symbol to eliminate the guard interval.

2. **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** – A forward FFT converts the time‑domain signal back into the frequency domain, recovering subcarrier symbols.

3. **Demodulation** – The frequency‑domain symbols are demodulated according to the selected modulation scheme (QPSK or 16‑QAM) to recover bit sequences.

4. **Bit Error Rate (BER) Calculation** – The recovered bit sequence is compared with the original transmitted bit stream to compute BER, which quantifies system performance under noise and channel conditions.

This receiver chain mirrors the transmitter design and enables an end‑to‑end performance evaluation of the OFDM system.
