# OFDM System Overview

## Overview

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a multi‑carrier modulation technique widely used in modern wireless communication systems such as Wi‑Fi, LTE, and 5G.

OFDM divides the available bandwidth into multiple orthogonal subcarriers, each modulated with a low‑rate data stream. This structure significantly reduces inter‑symbol interference (ISI) caused by multipath propagation and enables simpler frequency‑domain processing at the receiver.

All signals in this project are modeled at the **complex baseband level**, focusing on PHY‑layer signal processing rather than RF front‑end implementation.

This document provides an overview of the OFDM system, including **system architecture, signal model, receiver processing, simulation parameters, and future extensions**.

## Mathematical Foundations

### OFDM Time‑Domain Symbol Generation

Each OFDM symbol is generated by applying an **Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT)** to a block of modulated symbols:

$$
x[n] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X_k \cdot e^{j 2 \pi k n / N}, \quad n = 0, 1, \dots, N-1
$$

Where:  
- \(X_k\): modulated symbol on subcarrier \(k\) (e.g., QPSK or 16‑QAM)  
- \(N\): FFT size / number of subcarriers

> **Explanation:** The IFFT converts frequency‑domain symbols \(X_k\) into a time‑domain OFDM waveform \(x[n]\). Maintaining orthogonality between subcarriers enables simple frequency‑domain demodulation at the receiver. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### Cyclic Prefix (CP) Construction

To mitigate ISI caused by multipath channels, a cyclic prefix of length \(N_{CP}\) is appended:

$$
x_{CP}[n] = x[N - N_{CP} + n], \quad n = 0, 1, \dots, N_{CP} - 1
$$

The transmitted OFDM symbol becomes:

$$
x_{tx}[n] = [x_{CP}[0], x_{CP}[1], \dots, x_{CP}[N_{CP}-1], x[0], x[1], \dots, x[N-1]]
$$

> **Explanation:** The cyclic prefix is a repetition of the end of the OFDM symbol appended at the start to create a guard interval, preserving subcarrier orthogonality even in the presence of delay spread. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

### QPSK / 16‑QAM Modulation Mapping

For QPSK, each pair of bits \((b_0, b_1)\) maps to a complex symbol:

$$
s = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (2b_0 - 1) + j(2b_1 - 1) \right)
$$

For 16‑QAM, groups of 4 bits \((b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3)\) map to a constellation point:

$$
s = \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}} \left[ (2b_0 + b_1 - 1.5) + j(2b_2 + b_3 - 1.5) \right]
$$

> **Note:** Normalization ensures unit average power across symbols. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## Receiver Processing

At the receiver side, after passing through the channel and removing any noise/impairments:

1. **Cyclic Prefix Removal:**  
   The cyclic prefix is discarded from each received OFDM time‑domain symbol.

2. **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT):**  
   A forward FFT converts the time‑domain OFDM symbol back into the frequency domain, recovering each subcarrier’s modulated symbols.

3. **Demodulation:**  
   Once in the frequency domain, the symbols are demodulated (e.g., QPSK or QAM) into bit sequences.

4. **Bit Error Rate (BER) Calculation:**  
   The recovered bits are compared with the original transmitted bits to compute BER, which quantifies system performance under noise and channel conditions.

This receiver chain mirrors the transmitter design and is essential to evaluate overall system performance.
